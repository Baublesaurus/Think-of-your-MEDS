Reference implementation of the bachelor thesis by Cato van Ojen.

The unseeded version of the protocol can be executed by running:
`$ sage MPC.sage`

The seeded version of the protocol can be executed by running: 
`$ sage MPCs.sage`

For both versions of the protocol, suggested parameter sets can be found in
params.py

## Bachelor thesis
When completed, the link to the accompanying bachelor thesis will be placed here. 

## Credit
This implementation is mostly an adaptation of the reference implementation of MEDS.
